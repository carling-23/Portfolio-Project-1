      <h2>Hi, I'm Carling Lobello.</h2
        <p>I am a stay-at-home mom and a Thinkful Engineering student. It's so exciting to ponder on what the future holds with this career path, especially living in Nashville, Tennessee. </p>

 <section id="about-me">
      <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>As a stay-at-home mom looking to rejoin the workforce, but seeking a challening and rewarding new career path, I was thrilled to have found this program.</p>
        <p>In what I've learned about web development, it's a space that is completely and uniquely enticing. My favorite discovery has been that it's akin to solving a puzzle, but with the flexibility to accommodate how an individual thinks.</p>
        <p>What I've seen in the way of opportunities for colaboration with others has been equally exciting.</p>
        <p>  </p>
        <p>A few things I enjoy outside of web development:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Activites with my kids are a personal favorite, preferably outside.</li>
          <li>I love listening to music and getting lost in a project or task.</li>
          <li>At the end of the day, very few solitary endeavors are more enjoyable than finding a comfy chair, a great book, and a cup of something warm to drink.</li>
        </ol>
